# One-hop-trains-between-hwh-and-vskp
the program is designed to find out all the possible pair of trains feasible for one hop travel between Visakhapatnam and Howrah
Due to limitation of the data set used, there are some limitations to the program. Due to unavailbility of information about the day on which a train runs, all trains are assumed to be running daily. So all pairs may not be really feasible.
